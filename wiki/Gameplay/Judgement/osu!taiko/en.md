## Judgement mechanics

**Small/Large Notes:**

- *GREAT* given if drummed inside the judgement circle perfectly with correct colour.
- *GOOD* given if drummed slightly away from the judgement circle with correct colour.
- *MISS/BAD* given if drummed too early, too late, missed the judgement circle, or drummed the wrong colour.

**Drumroll:**

- Constant 300/600 score with Kiai Time bonus when available given per small notes drummed successfully in the drumroll with any colour.
- No score given when drummed on the gap of the small notes.
- No *MISS/BAD* for not doing the drumroll as per *Taiko no Tatsujin* style.

**Denden/Shaker:**

- Constant 300 score given per hit/shake until completed.
- *GREAT* given on the last hit/shake.
- *MISS/BAD* damage given (not considered a miss) if failed to complete the Denden/Shaker successfully.
