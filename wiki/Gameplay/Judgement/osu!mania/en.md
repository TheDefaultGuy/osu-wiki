# osu!mania judgement system

<!-- TODO: the article itself may probably be simplified -->

## Hit values

| Image | Name | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| ![](/wiki/shared/judgement/osu!mania/mania-hit300g.gif "Rainbow 300") | Rainbow 300 (MAX) | Perfect hit of the note or hold. Comparing to 300, getting this mark required dead-on accuracy to get it. Otherwise, a regular 300 will be given. Completing the beatmap with just this score will give the maximum 1,000,000 score (1 million score limit). This is equivalent to *Marvelous* in DDR term. |
| ![](/wiki/shared/judgement/osu!mania/mania-hit300.png "300") | 300 | Almost perfect hit of the note or hold. Maximum score limit cannot be achieved if this score was given. |
| ![](/wiki/shared/judgement/osu!mania/mania-hit200.png "200") | 200 | Slightly early or slightly late hit or hold. New players may get this mark a lot until they got accustomed to the mechanism of the conveyor, speed, buttons and the judgement area. |
| ![](/wiki/shared/judgement/osu!mania/mania-hit100.png "100") | 100 | Early or late hit or hold. It does not affect the HP bar at all. |
| ![](/wiki/shared/judgement/osu!mania/mania-hit50.png "50") | 50 | Very early or very late hit or hold. This score will be given for unreleased hold notes by default. Decreases HP, but not for a drastic amount. Does not break combo. |
| ![](/wiki/shared/judgement/osu!mania/mania-hit0.png "Miss") | Miss | Not hitting the note or holding the note using the correct keys. Drastically drain the HP and breaks the current combo. |

## Judgement mechanics

**Notes:**

- MAX (rainbow 300), 300, 200, 100 or 50 from a note depending on timing of hit.
- A Miss given when missing a note or hit it way too early.

**Hold notes:**

- The judgement for hold notes depends on both starting hold and ending release points.
- Keep holding till end of note, with initial and final with perfect timing: MAX
- Keep holding till end of note, without releasing the note: 200
- Do a *NG* and not recover the hold note: Miss
- Do a *NG* and even hold back the note: 50

NG: *Not Good*, a term in *StepMania/DDR*, which happens when the hold note was released during hold timing.
