# Proto-bubble

The **proto-bubble** (***pubble***) was a forum post icon used by members of the [Mapping Assistance Team](/wiki/People/Mapping_Assistance_Team) (*MAT*) in [previous iterations](/wiki/Modding/Forum_modding) of the [beatmap ranking process](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure). It was designed to indicate [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap) believed to be of a suitably high quality for [ranking](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked) by members of the [Beatmap Appreciation Team](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Appreciation_Team) (*BAT*), who could then place a [full bubble](/wiki/Modding/Bubble) icon if the beatmap met their approval.

The proto-bubble was introduced on the 27th of December, alongside the creation of the MAT.[^1]

The proto-bubble was retired on the 23rd of April, 2013, with the dissolution of the MAT and the promotion of all current team members to the BAT.[^2]
