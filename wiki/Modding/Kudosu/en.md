# Kudosu

**Kudosu** is a reward system for [modding](/wiki/Modding). It awards points for successful mod posts in [beatmap discussions](/wiki/Beatmap_Discussion). Accumulated points can be seen on a user's profile page.

In [forum modding](/wiki/Modding/Forum_modding), kudosu was exchangeable for [star priority](/wiki/Modding/Star_priority).

The word *kudosu*, sometimes stylised as *kudosu!*, is a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) of *kudos* and *osu!*.

<!-- TODO:

  - "You could explain kudosu's usage in evaluating BN applications, its past usage in BN Ranking systems" -jbhyperion
  - how it looks and works in beatmap discussions
  - when is it appropriate to award kd
