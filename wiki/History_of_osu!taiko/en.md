# History of osu!taiko

The history of osu!taiko compiled for the osu! wiki.

## 2007-2008: The Dark Period

The Dark Period was the brief moment in time where osu!taiko didn't exist. During this time, the [Beatmap Approval Team](wiki/Modding/Beatmap_Appreciation_Team/en.md) (*BAT*) was created who were the very first people in charge of the ranking process. On the 28th of August, 2008, Resident Skinner [LuigiHann](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1079) made a [forum post](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1683) proposing the addition of a game mode based on the video game series [Taiko no Tatsujin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiko_no_Tatsujin). When interviewed about this, [LuigiHann](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1079) said:

> Yes, Taiko Mode (and the broader concept of alternate game modes) was effectively my idea. As far as I can recall, Catch the Beat and Relax Mode were also my requests. I think Mania mode came about later since I didn't think that kind of thing made sense organically from osu maps. I was a big fan of the Taiko games that came out on the Nintendo DS, that was basically my exposure to "real" taiko. I did own a copy of Taiko Drum Master for PS2 but I think I got that from eBay relatively late. But the specific idea of including a "Taiko Mode" in osu was inspired by the Taiko-themed minigame in the Nodame Cantabile DS game.

[LuigiHann](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1079) is well known in the Taiko community because of his [Taiko skin](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/41319?start=610187), which was the very first popular skin for the game mode. Regarding that, [LuigiHann](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1079) said:

> I actually made the [Taiko skin](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/41319?start=610187) before the mode was a real thing. I think I must have made the taiko skin after suggesting taiko mode, since the taiko mode posts are super early, but as far as I recall I made the skin before the mode became a real thing. at any rate I intended it as a novelty skin for standard mode, and didn't exactly have taiko mode in mind when I was making it. I thought it was neat and interesting that the taiko community adapted it into such an authentic skin for taiko mode.

## 2008-2011: Age of Growth

The Age of Growth was when Taiko was added to osu! and the osu!taiko community started to grow. 

### Taiko's is added to osu!

Taiko [was added](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/15?n=355) to osu! on the 6th of May 2008. Initially, it wasn’t a separate game mode but rather a mod. By playing a map with this mod, it would convert any osu!standard map into a playable Taiko map. 

![](/wiki/History_of_osu!taiko/img/selection-mod-taiko.png "Taiko's mod icon")

### First Ranked Taiko Difficulty

On the 22nd of May, 2008, the very first Ranked Taiko difficulty was added. It belongs to the map [Saitama2000](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/210#osu/699) by the mapper [Kharl](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/452). It's important to note that the map itself was actually ranked before Taiko was added. The Taiko difficulty was [added later](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/856?n=7) by the mapper and then subsequently ranked by [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2).

### Special Mode

On the 18th of October, 2008, Taiko would go from being a mod to a separate game mode when the “Special” mode selection tab [was added](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/15?n=600).

![](/wiki/History_of_osu!taiko/img/specialtab.png "Special mode selection tab")

The Special mode menu allowed you to play one of the two alternative game modes at the time: Taiko and Fruits which would quickly be renamed to [Catch the Beat](wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch/en.md).

![](/wiki/History_of_osu!taiko/img/specialmodescreen.jpg "Special mode menu screen")

### Change and Development

From 2009-2008 was a period of rapid change and development for Taiko. When looking at the archived [development changelogs](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/15), its shows that big changes were being made almost every single day. Because of the large number of changes done to the game mode around this time, there was a score wipe around mid to late 2009.

Taiko gameplay around this time was very similar to how it is today with one major exception. In the beginning, sliders didn't have a cap to how many notes you could play, they basically worked exactly how they do in Taiko no Tatsujin. This quirk was easily exploitable by players and it made it so that the top plays on any given difficulty would devolve into who could land the most hits on the sliders.

### Important People

During this time, the first major figure in Taiko’s history appears, [mattyu007](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4934). On the 28th of August 2008, [mattyu007](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4934) was added to the BAT. [mattyu007](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4934) was the first BAT that "specialized" in Taiko. It's important to note that "specialized" in this case does not mean that their only job was to check Taiko difficulties. The main job of all BATs during this time was to check osu!standard maps,  "Specialized" in this case basically refers to something that a BAT happened to be good at in addition to osu!standard. There used to be a chart listing all of the BATs alongside the additional languages they spoke as well as their "Specialization".

![](/wiki/History_of_osu!taiko/img/batlist.JPG "List of BATs from 2012 and their specialization")

When asked about specialization, former BAT, [wmfchris](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7401) explains:

> “If I am not mistaken, the chart is basically filled by the members themselves just to say who's good at what and who you could in particular ask for help. It has nothing to do with official enforcements. There might be rules saying that you need BATs with taiko experiences for sets with taiko diffs already, but at exactly what time that happened I can't recall now.”

On the 29th of March 2009, the [Mapping Assistance Team](wiki/Modding/Mapping_Assistance_Team/en.md) (*MAT*) was founded.

While Taiko didn't receive many difficulties around this time, there were a few notable mappers. Mappers such as [Zekira](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/36749), [DJPop](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2363), [Sushi971](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/43108), [aquabluu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6537), [arken1015](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/113646), [wmfchris](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7401), [NatsumeRin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/151679) and [lepidopodus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/194807) were ranking several osu!standard maps with Taiko difficulties. 

### First Taiko Guidelines

Taiko mapping was brand new and there weren't any guidelines until the 10th of June, 2010, when the first proper [Taiko Guidelines](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/31560) were written by [Rokodo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23374). These guidelines would serve as an "Unofficial Ranking Criteria". These guidelines were based on the Taiko no Tatsujin games.

## 2011-2014: Age of Independence

The Age of Independence is when Taiko establishes itself as a completely independent game mode.

### First Taiko World Cup

The first major event to start the Age of Independence was the [First Taiko World Cup](wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2011/en.md) in 2011. The TWC was a major event for the community since it was the very first of its kind. It was managed by [Alace](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25993), [arken1015](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/113646), [lepidopodus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/194807), [Noobita](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/119188), and [wmfchris](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7401). During the TWC, a temporary channel was created called #twc. It was a popular place for taiko players to hang out since there wasn’t a dedicated channel for the game mode. However, after the TWC concluded, the channel was deleted. This left Taiko players with no place to talk and so on the 30th of May, 2011, a [forum post](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/54137) would be made by [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128) requesting the addition of a #taiko channel. It was eventually added thanks to this post.

A few notable figures would appear during early 2012, [wmfchris](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7401), [kanpakyin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/394326), [NatsumeRin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/151679), and later on [MMzz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/128993) would join the MAT and would be later on moved to the BAT. They were some of the first BATs that specialized in Taiko after [mattyu007](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4934).

### First Official Taiko Ranking Criteria

On the 22th of January 2012, the first official Taiko Ranking Criteria was proposed via a [forum post](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/72569). This version of the Taiko Ranking Criteria was written by [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128) and was based off of the [guidelines](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/31560) written by [Rokodo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23374). This Ranking Criteria would later be officially adopted. 

### First Ranked Taiko-only Mapset

On the 7th of August, 2012, the very first Taiko-only mapset was ranked, [Red Goose](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/55920#taiko/169369) by the mapper [lepidopodus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/194807). This was a momumental step forward for the osu!taiko community as it cemented the fact that they were a separate game mode that didn't need osu!standard just for it to exist. When asked about how the ranking process was like for the map, they said:

> At that time, I was already considered as one of the best taiko mapper by both taiko and other mods community, so the process wasn’t rough to me. I don’t know if others were trying to rank the first taiko map set, actually. Anyway, that was a pretty decent taiko map set and I think others acknowledged that too. Good for the first ranked mapset.

### Taiko BAT

A year later on the 2nd of August, 2013, the [osu!taiko BAT](wiki/Staff_Log/2013/en.md) was formed. The osu!taiko BATs were BATs that were dedicated to only checking Taiko mapsets. This is different from the Taiko "specialized" BATs mentioned previously. The creation of the Taiko BAT was requested by [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128) to [Ephemeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335). The original roster consisted of [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128) and [Tasha](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1031958); a few days later they would be joined by [KanaRin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/310747) and [aabc271](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/155707).

The last event to happen in the Age of Independence would be the creation of the first [Taiko-only beatmap pack](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs/817) on the 6th of November, 2013.

## 2014-2015: Period of Stagnation

The Period of Stagnation is when Taiko started to stagnate after the big boost in popularity brought by the Age of Independence. During this time activity died down quite a bit and a lot less maps were being ranked. During an interview for [Coffee Hour](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/248932474), [Tasha](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1031958), now known as [karterfreak](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1031958) explains the reason why:

> Because we had the (#taiko) channel we started seeing a lot more people interested in the game and it coincided with the TWC, just all that stuff happening at the same time kind of brought in a lot of new players that were interested in the game. However, after that, it kinda slowed down a little bit. So the mapping scene when rankable sets started coming in it started to grow but after that initial spurt of growth it kind of died down a little bit for a couple of years. We didn't get as many maps getting pushed through for a couple of different reasons. One of the main reasons being that people that had been involved with the ranking process for Taiko at that time were pretty conservative in their ideals of what made a good Taiko map.

On the 21st of August 2014, [it was announced](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2014-08-21-restructuring-of-the-bat) that the BAT would be split into 2 groups: the BAT and a new group known as the [Quality Assurance Team](wiki/Modding/Quality_Assurance_Team/en.md) (*QAT*). From then on, the job of the BAT was to nominate maps, while the QAT’s job was to check the maps that were qualified and disqualify those that either didn’t meet the Ranking Criteria or their standards.

## 2015-2019: Age of Creativity

The Age of Creativity is when Taiko mappers started to push the limits of what was deemed rankable by creating and subsequently ranking harder maps as well as developing more creative mapping styles.

### Harder Maps

The event that started the Age of Creativity was the [first Taiko-only mapping contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2015-04-13-monthly-beatmapping-contest-9-taiko-only) which was announced on the 13th of April, 2015.

A few months later, the first black icon Taiko difficulty was ranked, [8 Sides of Nico Nico Douga](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/192392#taiko/457542) by the mapper [bbj0920](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/87546). This is significant because even though Taiko maps were considerably hard from the very beginning, there were no ranked maps hard enough to actually challenge top players.

On the 26th of September, 2015, the first 7★ Taiko difficulty was ranked, [Aragami](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/225377#taiko/525910) by the mapper [Sayaka-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/398275). Almost exactly a month later on the 25th of October, 2015, the first 8★ Taiko difficulty was ranked, [Galaxy Collapse](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/328117#taiko/727903) by the same mapper, [Sayaka-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/398275). Both maps were ahead of their time and faced some opposition during the ranking process. Both maps were ahead of their time, so much in fact that most people modding [Aragami](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/225377#taiko/525910) explicitely said that they had no idea how to mod the top difficulty. However, the people that did have enough experience to properly mod the map, were not comfortable with the map being ranked. One such person was [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128). When interviewed about why they opposed the map at the beginning, [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128) said:

> ...some of us, especially me, were very conservative during these times. But that had different reasons. While we definitely haven't predicted certain difficulties to be playable in the future and hence simply disallowed certain patterns (like 1/4 finishers or 1/8), we also tried to have a gradual change in the meta instead of just jumping straight to ridiculous hard maps. There was the fear that if we don't educate new mappers and evolve as a community alongside mapping, that the difficulty would escalate without understanding the concept of taiko...

However, [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128) himself bubbled [Galaxy Collapse](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/328117#taiko/727903) despite initially being against [Aragami](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/225377#taiko/525910). When asked why they had a change of heart, they said:

> Sayaka was a special case to be honest. The thing is, we weren’t really opposed to unorthodox maps for rank. It was just that most people had no idea how to make a good map… That makes me come to Aragami. Because here there was a personal change in how I handled things. More and more people wanted harder maps, so I tried to kinda adapt to it… That's why you see me oppose the map at first, give some suggestions, and later on came to an agreement with Sayaka.

### Taiko Nominator Association

Around the time all 3 maps were going through the ranking process, the [Taiko Nominator Association](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/357613) (*TNA*) was founded on the 15th of August, 2015. The TNA was essentially a group of Taiko Nominators that shared one big unified modding queue. This was done in hopes of making the ranking process for Taiko a lot faster and easier. However, the TNA had some drawbacks. Nominators that were part of the TNA could not take requests outside of the TNA queue, and only a few maps were selected by the Nominators. This lead to an imbalance of pending maps and mapes being ranked. Because of this, the TNA would later be disbanded.

![](/wiki/History_of_osu!taiko/img/TMT.png "Taiko Nominator Association Banner")

The [loved section was added](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2016-10-17-here-comes-the-love) on the 17th of October 2016, and a few days later the first Taiko map would be loved, [Shiawase ni nareru kakushi komando ga aru rashii](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/219733#taiko/514465) by the mapper [Firce777](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/274072).

On the 25th of May, 2017, Taiko would receive it's official mascot, [Mocha](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2017-05-25-the-new-osutaiko-mascot-is-here). 
![](/wiki/History_of_osu!taiko/img/12.jpg "Mocha's original design that was submitted for the art contest.")

### Easier Taiko BN Tests

Around this time, Taiko Beatmap Nominator tests were made easier. These tests were actualy very hard, so much so that before the tests were made easier, 2 out of 15 participants passed, but after they were made easier, 8 out of 19 passed. This proved to be beneficial since there were very few Nominators at the time. More Nominators meant more maps being ranked as well as a wider variety of songs and mapping styles.

### Taiko Ranking Criteria Rework

On the 27th of September 2017, the Taiko Ranking Criteria received its first major rework since it was first written. [Raiden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2239480) along with many other members of the community would create [a draft](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/518637?n=1) as a proposal and then further refine it with input from the general community until it was eventually adapted and made official. This reworked Ranking Criteria is the one used today. 

## 2019-Present: Modern Age

The Modern Age starts off with the restructure of the QAT to the [Nomination Assessment Team](wiki/People/The_Team/Nomination_Assessment_Team/en.md) (*NAT*) on the 5th of May, 2019.

On the 18th of January, 2020, the NAT held a meeting discussing a system Taiko was using for dealing with applications of previous Beatmap Nominators who wanted to return. The system Taiko had in place basically allowed previous Beatmap Nominators to rejoin much easier if they left on good terms. This system proved successful and was adopted by the other gamemodes.

On the 16th of September, 2020, the [new Taiko Star Rating System](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-09-15-changes-to-osutaiko-star-rating ) was finally implemented.

On the 30th of November, 2020, Hybrid maps were required to have 2 BNs per gamemode in order to be qualified. This means that if a map had difficulties from all 4 game modes, then it would need 8 Beatmap Nominators in order to be qualified. This was a stark contrast to the previous system where hybrids only needed 2 Nominators. Because of this new system, the ranked section did not receive a Hybrid map for months.
