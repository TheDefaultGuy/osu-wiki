# History of osu!taiko

The history of osu!taiko compiled for the osu! wiki.

## 2007-2008: The Dark Period

The Dark Period was the brief moment in time where osu!taiko didn't exist. During this time, the [Beatmap Approval Team](wiki/Modding/Beatmap_Appreciation_Team/en.md) (*BAT*) was created who were the very first people in charge of the ranking process. On the 28th of August, 2008, Resident Skinner [LuigiHann](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1079) made a [forum post](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1683) proposing the addition of a game mode based on the video game series [Taiko no Tatsujin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiko_no_Tatsujin). When interviewed about this, [LuigiHann](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1079) said:

> Yes, Taiko Mode (and the broader concept of alternate game modes) was effectively my idea. As far as I can recall, Catch the Beat and Relax Mode were also my requests. I think Mania mode came about later since I didn't think that kind of thing made sense organically from osu maps. I was a big fan of the Taiko games that came out on the Nintendo DS, that was basically my exposure to "real" taiko. I did own a copy of Taiko Drum Master for PS2 but I think I got that from eBay relatively late. But the specific idea of including a "Taiko Mode" in osu was inspired by the Taiko-themed minigame in the Nodame Cantabile DS game.

[LuigiHann](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1079) is well known in the Taiko community because of his [Taiko skin](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/41319?start=610187), which was the very first popular skin for the game mode. Regarding that, [LuigiHann](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1079) said:

> I actually made the [Taiko skin](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/41319?start=610187) before the mode was a real thing. I think I must have made the taiko skin after suggesting taiko mode, since the taiko mode posts are super early, but as far as I recall I made the skin before the mode became a real thing. at any rate I intended it as a novelty skin for standard mode, and didn't exactly have taiko mode in mind when I was making it. I thought it was neat and interesting that the taiko community adapted it into such an authentic skin for taiko mode.

## 2008-2011: Age of Growth

The Age of Growth was when Taiko was added to osu! and the osu!taiko community started to grow. Taiko was added on the 6th of May 2008. 

Initially, it wasn’t a separate game mode but rather a mod. By playing a map with this mod, it would convert any osu!standard map into a playable taiko map.

On the 22nd of May, 2008, the very first Ranked Taiko difficulty was added. It belongs to the map [Saitama2000](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/210#osu/699) by the mapper [Kharl](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/452). Its important to note that the map itself was actually ranked before Taiko was added. The Taiko difficulty was [added later](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/856?n=7) by the mapper and then subsequently ranked by [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2).

On the 18th of October, 2008, Taiko would go from being a mod to a separate game mode when the “Special” mode selection tab [was added](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/15?n=600).

The Special mode menu allowed you to play one of the two alternative game modes at the time: Taiko and Fruits which would quickly be renamed to [Catch the Beat](wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch/en.md).

From 2009-2008 was a period of rapid change and development for Taiko. When looking at the archived [development changelogs](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/15), its shows that big changes were being made almost every single day. Because of the large number of changes done to the game mode around this time, there was a score wipe around mid to late 2009.

Taiko gameplay around this time was very similar to how it is today with one major exception. In the beginning, sliders didn't have a cap to how many notes you could play, they basically worked exactly how they do in Taiko no Tatsujin. This quirk was easily exploitable by players and it made it so that the top plays on any given difficulty would devolve into who could land the most hits on the sliders.

uring this time the first major figure in Taiko’s history appears, [mattyu007](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4934). On the 28th of August 2008, [mattyu007](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4934) was added to the BAT. The reason this is important is because [mattyu007](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4934) was the first BAT that "specialized" in Taiko. It's important to note that "specialized" in this case does not mean that their only job was to check Taiko difficulties. The main job of all BATs during this time was to check osu!standard maps,  "Specialized" in this case basically refers to something that a BAT happened to be good at in addition to osu!standard. There used to be a chart listing all of the BATs alongside the additional languages they spoke as well as their "Specialization".

![](/wiki/History_of_osu!taiko/img/batlist.JPG "List of BATs from 2012")

When asked about Specialization, former BAT, [wmfchris](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7401) explains:

> “If I am not mistaken, the chart is basically filled by the members themselves just to say who's good at what and who you could in particular ask for help. It has nothing to do with official enforcements. There might be rules saying that you need BATs with taiko experiences for sets with taiko diffs already, but at exactly what time that happened I can't recall now.”

On the 29th of March 2009, the [Mapping Assistance Team](wiki/Modding/Mapping_Assistance_Team/en.md) (*MAT*) was founded.

While Taiko didn't receive many difficulties around this time, there were a few notable mappers. Mappers such as [Zekira](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/36749), [DJPop](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2363), [Sushi971](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/43108), [aquabluu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6537), [arken1015](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/113646), [wmfchris](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7401), [NatsumeRin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/151679) and [lepidopodus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/194807) were ranking several osu!standard maps with Taiko difficulties. Taiko mapping was brand new and there weren't any Guidelines until the 10th of June, 2010, when the first proper [Taiko Guidelines](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/31560) were written by [Rokodo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23374). These guidelines would serve as an "Unofficial Ranking Criteria".

## 2011-2014: Age of Independence

The Age of Independence is when Taiko establishes itself as a completely independent game mode.

The first major event to start the Age of Independence was the [First Taiko World Cup](wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2011/en.md) in 2011. The TWC was a major event for the community since it was the very first of its kind. It was managed by [Alace](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25993), [arken1015](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/113646), [lepidopodus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/194807), [Noobita](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/119188), and [wmfchris](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7401). During the TWC, a temporary channel was created called #twc. It was a popular place for taiko players to hang out since there wasn’t a dedicated channel for the game mode. However, after the TWC concluded, the channel was deleted. This left Taiko players with no place to talk and so on the 30th of May, 2011, a [forum post](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/54137) would be made by [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128) requesting the addition of a #taiko channel. It was eventually added thanks to this post.

A few notable figures would appear during early 2012, [wmfchris](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7401), [kanpakyin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/394326), [NatsumeRin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/151679), and later on [MMzz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/128993) would join the MAT and would be later on moved to the BAT. They were some of the first BATs that specialized in Taiko after [mattyu007](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4934).

On the 22th of January 2012, the first official Taiko Ranking Criteria was proposed via a [forum post](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/72569). This version of the Taiko Ranking Criteria was written by [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128). This Ranking Criteria would be adapted and months later on the 7th of August, 2012, the very first Taiko-only mapset was ranked, [Red Goose](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/55920#taiko/169369) by the mapper [lepidopodus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/194807). 

A year later on the 2nd of August, 2013, the [osu!taiko BAT](wiki/Staff_Log/2013/en.md) was formed. The osu!taiko BATs were BATs that were dedicated to only checking Taiko mapsets. This is different from the Taiko "specialized" BATs mentioned previously. The creation of the Taiko BAT was requested by [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128) to [Ephemeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335). The original roster consisted of [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128) and [Tasha](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1031958); a few days later they would be joined by [KanaRin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/310747) and [aabc271](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/155707).

The last event to happen in the Age of Independence would be the creation of the first [Taiko-only beatmap pack](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs/817) on the 6th of November, 2013.

## 2014-2015: Period of Stagnation

The Period of Stagnation is when Taiko started to stagnate after the big boost in popularity brought by the Age of Independence. During this time activity died down quite a bit and a lot less maps were being ranked. During an interview for [Coffee Hour](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/248932474), [Tasha](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1031958), now known as [karterfreak](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1031958) explains the reason why.

> Because we had the (#taiko) channel we started seeing a lot more people interested in the game and it coincided with the TWC, just all that stuff happening a the same time kind of brought in a lot of new players that were interested in the game. However, after that, it kinda slowed down a little bit. So the mapping scene when rankable sets started coming in it started to grow but after that initial spurt of growing it kind of died down a little bit for a couple of years. We didn't get as many maps getting pushed through for a couple of different reasons. One of the main reasons being that people that had been involved with the ranking process for Taiko at that time were pretty conservative in their ideals of what made a good Taiko map.

On the 21st of August 2014, [it was announced](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2014-08-21-restructuring-of-the-bat) that the BAT would be split into 2 groups: the BAT and a new group known as the [Quality Assurance Team](wiki/Modding/Quality_Assurance_Team/en.md) (*QAT*). From then on, the job of the BAT was to nominate maps, while the QAT’s job was to check the maps that were qualified and disqualify those that either didn’t meet the Ranking Criteria or their standards.

## 2015-2019: Age of Creativity

The Age of Creativity is when Taiko mappers started to push the limits of what was deemed rankable by creating and subsequently ranking harder maps as well as developing more creative mapping styles.

## 2019-Present: Modern Age
